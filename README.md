# -RRT-Implementation
•Implemented advanced path planning using RRT* Connect algorithm with additional rectangular bounds (inspired by BIT*) in ROS Noetic environment.
•Integrated Bressenham line algorithm for efficient trajectory generation, optimizing real-time plotting with matplotlib for visualization.
•Utilized KD-Tree for optimizing nearest neighbor search, enhancing efficiency and robustness in path planning computations.
